# Snake AI Terminal Game 🐍

This is a simple terminal-based Snake game where the snake is controlled by an AI using the A* search algorithm. 

## Features

- **AI-driven snake** that autonomously finds the shortest path to the food.
- The snake grows every time it eats food.
- Walls and snake body are obstacles to avoid.
- Terminal display with real-time board updates.
- Simple, lightweight Python implementation — no external dependencies.

## How It Works

The AI uses the A* algorithm to plan a path to the food while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body. If no path to food is found, it tries to move safely to survive longer.

## How to Run

Run the Python script in your terminal:
>>python3 snake_ai.py
